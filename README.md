# About

A new role playing game mode with entirely new mechanics for Garry's Mod. For now the development of this game mode is only really an experiment but could later change depending how well it performs.

# Warning

Currently only works in Multi-Player and in the "Dev" branch of Garry's Mod. Single-Player will come later.
### Dev Branch Functions Used
